  "readme": "# exp [![Slack](http://slack.expo.io/badge.svg)](https://slack.expo.io)\nThe Expo Development CLI\n\n## Installation\n\n[Installation instructions and documentation here.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/exp-cli.html)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo make a new project use `exp init [path]`. The path is optional and it will use the current directory if not specified (all commands that need a path behave similarly).\n\n## Viewing a Project on Your Phone\n\nTo view a project you must have an `exp` server running for that project. Run `exp start [path]` to start running the server. Once it is ready it'll output a url for your project.\n\n```bash\n$ exp start\n...\n[exp] Your URL is\n\nexp://3h-xu5.jesse.expo-example.exp.direct\n```\n\nThe server will continue running until you close it.\n\nTo view this on your phone, do the following:\n\n  * Go get the Expo app on your Android or iOS device. It's available [on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [on the iOS App Store](https://itunes.com/apps/exponent).\n\n  * Run `exp send` to send a link via email or text. You can also use the `--send-to` option when running `exp start`.\n\n  * Check your e-mail or texts and tap the link. The Expo app should open and you should be able to view your experience there!\n\n## Publishing a Project\n\nTo publish something you've made, just follow these steps:\n\n  * Create an Expo account or login to an existing one by running `exp login`.\n\n  * Run an `exp` server using `exp start`.\n\n  * Check to make sure you can load your app by sending the link to yourself with `exp send` and opening it in the Expo app.\n\n  * Once everything looks good, run `exp publish`. A few seconds later, you should get a clean URL sent to you that points to the exp.host server where your package was published to.\n\nYou can publish as many times as you want and it will replace your old version, so don't worry about making a mistake!\n",
